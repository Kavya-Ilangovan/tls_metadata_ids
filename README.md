# TLS Metadata-Based Intrusion Detection System

### üîê Detecting Encrypted Threats Without Decrypting Traffic

This project aims to implement a privacy-preserving Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that analyzes **TLS metadata** ‚Äî including JA3 fingerprints, Server Name Indication (SNI), and TLS handshake characteristics ‚Äî to detect malicious behavior in encrypted traffic **without decrypting it**.

---

## üåê Why This Matters

With over **90% of internet traffic encrypted** (HTTPS/TLS), traditional IDS systems that rely on Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) are increasingly ineffective. Our solution, using **Encrypted Traffic Analysis (ETA)**, enables:

- Threat detection without breaking encryption or user privacy.
- Identification of malware and C2 traffic using JA3 fingerprints.
- Real-time anomaly detection using TLS session behavior.

## üöß Project Timeline

| Phase | Deliverables | Time Estimate |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Setup & Traffic Capture** | Install Zeek, JA3 plugin, extract TLS logs from PCAP/live traffic | Week 1 |
| ‚úÖ **Phase 2: Basic Detection Engine** | Parse metadata, match JA3/SNI with known malware | Week 2 |
| ‚è≥ **Phase 3: Threat Intelligence Integration** | Use AbuseIPDB, OTX, or VirusTotal to enrich logs with real-world threat intel | Week 3 |
| ‚è≥ **Phase 4: Behavioral Modeling (ML)** | Train a lightweight model using TLS flow behavior (duration, entropy, handshake patterns) | Weeks 4‚Äì6 |
| ‚è≥ **Phase 5: Real-Time Pipeline** | Automate traffic processing, run detection continuously, optional alert system | Weeks 6‚Äì8 |
| ‚è≥ **Final Phase: Testing & Deployment** | Test on real datasets, performance evaluation, report, documentation | Week 9 |

## üß† Key Features

- **JA3 Fingerprinting**: Identify malware families based on TLS client behavior.
- **SNI Inspection**: Detect suspicious domains without decrypting HTTPS.
- **Threat Intel Integration**: Tag IPs/domains using third-party APIs.
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: Detect anomalous session behavior using unsupervised ML.
- **Privacy-First**: No payload decryption; compliant with legal and ethical standards.
